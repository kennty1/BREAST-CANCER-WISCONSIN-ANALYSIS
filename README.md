# Findings
### 1. All sales are for Hitch Rack bike accessories, indicating the dataset is focused on a niche product line.
### 2. Most records show positive profit margins, meaning the product is generally profitable across different customers and locations.
### The Adults (35) age group (both male and female) appears frequently, suggesting they are the primary buyers.
### 4. A few transactions come from Youth (<25), but their order quantities tend to be lower, possibly indicating lower purchasing power or interest.
### 5. The Unit Price is steady at $120, while the Unit Cost is $45, giving a constant markup that simplifies profitability analysis.
### 6.Customers are located mainly in Australia (New South Wales & Victoria) and Canada (British Columbia), suggesting focused regional markets.
### 7. Orders range from 1 unit to 23 units, showing a mix of small personal and bulk purchases.

# Recommendation
### 1.Introduce additional bike accessory types to diversify product lines and increase customer value per order.
### 2.Focus marketing and retention strategies on Adults (35+), especially in Australia and Canada, as they generate the most revenue.
### 3.Consider discounts or entry-level products targeted at the <25 age group to grow their customer base and build early brand loyalty.
### 4.Explore new provinces or countries with similar profiles to Australia and Canada to scale up sales geographically.
### 5.Introduce tiered pricing or bundle deals for bulk orders to incentivize larger purchases while protecting margins.
